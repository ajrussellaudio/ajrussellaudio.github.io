# Code Blocks

I write a lot of stuff with code blocks, and it would be nice to see what they look like.

```javascript
function doSomething() {
  // define functions up here
}

window.addEventListener("load", function() {
  var loopCount = 20;
  for (var i = 0; i < loopCount; i++) {
    // for loop goes in here
    doSomething(); // call functions here
  }
});
```
